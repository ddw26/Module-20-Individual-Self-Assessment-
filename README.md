## Self Assessment
This project really allowed me to understand Github's functionality. When the course first began, I was missing assignments and turning in the wrong assignments all because I did not have a working understanding of Github. Now, I am navigating Github quite easily. Secondly, working with my teammates gave me more hands on experience and a deeper understanding of Machine Learning. Asking them questions and having thourough walk throughs with the mechanics behind our model made it click! Machine Learning has become one of my favorite topics within the entire course. Lastly, I did face personal challenges in the middle of the project- I made sure to communicate extensively with my teammates, and they were very understanding. In the end, despite what came up I was determined to complete our final project.

## Team Assessment
Overall, my team was AWESOME! They were personally kind, very understanding, and amiable when it came to role responsibilities. My teammate Anthony was particularly encouraging. I was also impressed with his work in our interactive model via Tableau. Chris and Chandler paid very close attention to detail and really tackled much of the backend work, whilst still explaining their process, and allowing for other teammate input.  

## Project Summary
In summary, the objective of our project was to create a machine learning model + corresponding analysis for fishers and boating companies. The model predicted the most favorable outcomes for fishers based on varying conditions. The data we used showcased several fish species and what circumstances made a substantial catch. We visualized the average amount of time spent on fishing. We chose North Carolina as a sample state, with focus on it's coastal counties.
